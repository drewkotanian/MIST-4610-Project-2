# Description of Dataset:
Our dataset dives into the world of Real Estate Sales in Connecticut from 2001 to 2020, pulling insights from the meticulous records kept by the Office of Policy and Management. It's a bit like the crime dataset we snagged from (https://catalog.data.gov/), weaving a story through diverse dimensions. Each sale, clocking in at a minimum of $2,000, goes down yearly between October 1 and September 30. We've got the lowdown on towns, property addresses, sale dates, and property types (think residential, apartment, commercial, industrial, or vacant land), all wrapped up in strings for some quality qualitative digging. Numbers come into play for the financial scoopâ€”sales price and property assessment, following the crime dataset's lead on encoding offense details. And there's a temporal layer too, with sale dates, years, months, and hours, ready for some time-travel analysis. Plus, we're spicing things up with latitude and longitude, offering a spatial twist comparable to our crime data adventures. So, our Real Estate Sales dataset for Connecticut? It's a rich tapestry, begging for exploration and analysis to spill the beans on the nuanced dance of property transactions in the state over those two decades.
