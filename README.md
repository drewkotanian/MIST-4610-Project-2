# Description of Dataset:
Our dataset meticulously captures the panorama of Real Estate Sales in Connecticut from 2001 to 2020, drawing insights from the exhaustive records maintained by the Office of Policy and Management. Each sale, requiring a minimum price of $2,000, annually occurs between October 1 and September 30, presenting crucial details such as a town, property address, sale date, and property type (classified as residential, apartment, commercial, industrial, or vacant land). These details are encoded to facilitate qualitative analysis. Numerical data types capture financial intricacies, including sales price and property assessment, enabling a nuanced exploration of the economic landscape. The dataset further encompasses temporal aspects, recording sale date, year, month, and hour, facilitating temporal analyses and trend identification. Geospatial information in the form of latitude and longitude enhances the dataset's richness, providing a spatial dimension for analysis. In essence, our Real Estate Sales dataset for Connecticut presents a comprehensive tapestry of dimensions, inviting exploration and analysis to uncover meaningful insights into the intricate dynamics of real estate transactions in the state over the specified time frame.

# Question 1:
Question: We are interested to find out, on average, which towns have the highest real estate sale price? For these towns, what residential types are more common in the market? Note: We have filtered the average sales results to only display towns in Connecticut with an average over a million dollars.

Importance:
This question is interesting because it helps us understand which towns in Connecticut have the highest mean household price. This data is able to open doors for more potential questions from buyers, given that higher household prices indicate wealthier areas, lower crime, and often better school systems. This can give developers and realtors in the area a better idea of how to value new homes, given that a sale can be hard if it is too far above competitors' average price. The second part of the question gives us an idea about what type of residential homes are most common out of these higher priced areas. This can show us how different residential types can affect the price of a home or apartment paired with it's location.
