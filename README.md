# Description of Dataset:
Our dataset digs into Connecticut's real estate scene from 2001 to 2020, pulling insights from the Office of Policy and Management's records. It's a snapshot of property transactions, covering key details like listing years, sale values, and property types. Each entry has a unique serial number, making it easy to track. The listing year gives a timeline, and the recorded date tells us when deals went down. Town and address details add a sense of place, letting us explore real estate changes across Connecticut. Financial info, like assessed and sale values, tells us about property worth and actual sale prices. The sale ratio gives a hint about how property values stack up. Categories like property type and residential type help break down the data, offering a closer look at different real estate segments. In a nutshell, our dataset is a window into Connecticut's real estate story. It's not just numbers; it's a tool for exploring the ups and downs, trends, and stories behind property transactions in the state.

# Question 1:
Question: We are interested to find out, on average, which towns have the highest real estate sale price? For these towns, what as the max sale amount? Note: We have filtered the average sales results to only display towns in Connecticut with an average over a million dollars.

Importance:
This question is interesting because it helps us understand which towns in Connecticut have the highest mean household price. This data is able to open doors for more potential questions from buyers, given that higher household prices indicate wealthier areas, lower crime, and often better school systems. This can give developers and realtors in the area a better idea of how to value new homes, given that a sale can be hard if it is too far above competitors' average price. The second part of the question gives us an idea about what type of residential homes are most common out of these higher priced areas. This can show us how different residential types can affect the price of a home or apartment paired with it's location.

# Question 2:
Question: For real estate sales with a sales ratio greater than one, what is the most common property type and town of the estate?

Importance:
Answering this question is crucial for two main reasons. First, when real estate sales have a sale ratio greater than one, it means the property is sold for less than its assessed value. This is not good because it indicates potential unfairness in how properties are valued for taxes. By figuring out the common property types and towns with this kind of sale ratio, we can spot areas where property values might be unfairly high. This discovery prompts further investigation and possible adjustments to make things fairer. Second, looking into this information helps us understand how competitive different areas are in the real estate market. If certain property types and towns consistently have sale ratios greater than one, it suggests that sellers might need to lower their prices. This could create opportunities for buyers to negotiate better deals. Knowing this gives people in the market a better idea of how to make smart decisions based on what's really happening. In summary, tackling this question is about finding out if properties are valued fairly and understanding where good opportunities might be for buyers and sellers in the real estate game.
