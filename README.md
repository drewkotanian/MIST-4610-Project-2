# Description of Dataset:
Our dataset details the Real Estate Sales in the state of Connecticut from 2001 to 2020. The Office of Policy and Management maintains a listing of all real estate sales with a sales price of $2,000 or greater that occur between October 1 and September 30 of each year. For each sale record, the file includes town, property address, date of sale, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial, or vacant land), sales price, and property assessment.
