# Description of Dataset:
Our dataset meticulously captures the panorama of Real Estate Sales in Connecticut from 2001 to 2020, drawing insights from the exhaustive records maintained by the Office of Policy and Management. Each sale, requiring a minimum price of $2,000, annually occurs between October 1 and September 30, presenting crucial details such as a town, property address, sale date, and property type (classified as residential, apartment, commercial, industrial, or vacant land). These details are encoded to facilitate qualitative analysis. Numerical data types capture financial intricacies, including sales price and property assessment, enabling a nuanced exploration of the economic landscape. The dataset further encompasses temporal aspects, recording sale date, year, month, and hour, facilitating temporal analyses and trend identification. Geospatial information in the form of latitude and longitude enhances the dataset's richness, providing a spatial dimension for analysis. In essence, our Real Estate Sales dataset for Connecticut presents a comprehensive tapestry of dimensions, inviting exploration and analysis to uncover meaningful insights into the intricate dynamics of real estate transactions in the state over the specified time frame.
